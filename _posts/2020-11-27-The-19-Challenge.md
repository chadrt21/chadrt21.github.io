Matt Parker's recent [puzzle](https://www.think-maths.co.uk/19challenge) has had me intrigued.

## The Challenge
"If you square all of the first 19 primes and add them you get a multiple of 19.
Enter any number n where the first n primes squared, add to a multiple of n. Any n â‰  1 counts, but bigger is better!"

In other words, find the largest n where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;p_i^2&space;)&space;%&space;n&space;=&space;0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;p_i^2&space;)&space;%&space;n&space;=&space;0" title="(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 ) % n = 0" /></a> where p<sub>i</sub> is the ith prime.

## The Approach
While there are many different approaches to a problem like this, since this looks like a simple enough problem, I decided to use a simple tool: Python.

The iteration was a quick brute force.

#### First version:
run time of the first 10,000 primes: ~2:37 minutes

```python
import math
import sympy
from datetime import datetime
from tqdm import tqdm   # progress bar (may need to install package from: https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

start = datetime.now()

n_max = 10000
n_array = []
primes = [sympy.prime(p) for p in tpdm(range(1,n_max+1))]
primes_sq = [math.pow(p,2) for p in primes]

for n in tpdm(range(1,n_max)):
    if((sum(primes_sq[:n]) % n) == 0):
        n_array.append(n)

print()
print("Duration:",datetime.now()-start)
print(n_array)
```

But it wasn't until I ran it that I realize a couple of issues with my first iteration of this program.

The main issue is the generation of prime numbers via [sympy.prime()](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/ntheory.html#sympy.ntheory.generate.prime)
which can take a while to generate all the primes of a given range; thus it doesn't scale well when generating on average 64-74 primes per second (at least on my computer).
If left generating primes for the full 6 days of the challenge it would only generate about 33,177,600 to 38,361,600 primes. I wasn't satisfied with that performance.

#### Latest version:
run time of the first 2 billion primes: ~48 minutes

I realize that it is likely that someone already has a database of primes, so why am I wasting compute resources and time generating primes?

I found a "[database](http://www.primos.mat.br/2T_en.html)" that has the first 2 billion primes (but also takes up ~20 GB).
I wrote an python script to download all 20 GB of primes:
```python
"""Primes downloader
Downloads 2 billion primes from http://www.primos.mat.br/2T_en.html for a total of 20 GB
"""

__author__ = "Chad Ross"
__email__ = "chadrt21@gmail.com"
__date__ = "2020-11-30"

import os
import py7zr
import requests
from tqdm import tqdm   # progress bar (may need to install package from: https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)


# Download & unzip prime numbers files from: http://www.primos.mat.br/2T_en.html
# Each file contains 10 million primes (~101 MB) -> total of 2 billion primes (~20 GB)
num_files = 200
prime_files_URL = ['http://www.primos.mat.br/dados/2T_part{}.7z'.format(f) for f in range(1,num_files+1)]
prime_files = ['2T_part{}.7z'.format(f) for f in range(1,num_files+1)]

# Confirm download of 20 GB
print()
print("NOTE: Depending on internet speed this may take a up to a few hours.")
ask = input("Do you want to download 2 billion primes which would take up 20 GB (y/n):")
if (ask.upper() == 'Y'):

    # Download files
    print('Downloading files')
    for c in tqdm(range(0,len(prime_files))):
        file = requests.get(prime_files_URL[c], allow_redirects=True)
        open(prime_files[c],'wb').write(file.content)


    # Unzip files to current directory
    print('Unzipping files')
    for c in tqdm(range(0,len(prime_files))):
        py7zr.SevenZipFile(prime_files[c],mode='r').extractall()

    # remove zip files
    print('Removing zipped files')
    for c in tqdm(range(0,len(prime_files))):
        os.remove(prime_files[c])
```

After I have downloaded the 2 billion primes I refactored my code to go through those primes more efficiently.

It now takes about 14 seconds for each prime file which each contain 10 million primes;
thus take about 48 minutes to check the first 2 billion primes.
Much improvement from the first iteration of this program to do the same number of primes.


```python
import numpy
from tqdm import tqdm   # progress bar (may need to install package from: https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

# Download & unzip prime numbers files from: http://www.primos.mat.br/2T_en.html
# Each file contains 10 million primes (~101 MB) -> total of 2 billion primes (~20 GB)
num_files = 200
prime_files = ['2T_part{}.txt'.format(f) for f in range(1,num_files+1)]

n_array = []

file_count = 0
n_count = 1
for c in tqdm(range(1,len(prime_files))):

    primes = numpy.loadtxt(prime_files[file_count])
    primes = primes.flatten()

    primes_sq = numpy.power(primes,2)
    primes_cumsum = numpy.cumsum(primes_sq)

    for n in range(1,len(primes)):
        if((primes_cumsum[n-1] % n_count) == 0):
            n_array.append(n_count)
        n_count += 1

    file_count += 1

print()
print('n_array:',n_array)
print('len(n_array):',len(n_array))
print()
print('max n:',f'{n_array[-1]:,}')
numpy.savetxt('mpmp19_out.txt',n_array, fmt='%d',header='All n of the first {:,} primes'.format(n_count))

```

## Results
The program found 124 primes that meet <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;p_i^2&space;)&space;%&space;n&space;=&space;0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;p_i^2&space;)&space;%&space;n&space;=&space;0" title="(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 ) % n = 0" /></a> in the first 2 billion primes:

I love simple problems like this which can show that programming is an iterative process.
